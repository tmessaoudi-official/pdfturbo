  pdfturbo CONTAINER ADAPTATION (2026-07-27). Imported from the developer's machine bundle
  `claude-setup-global-20260722` via the already-container-adapted phorj port. These deltas
  OVERRIDE the body below wherever they conflict:

  1. QUESTIONS ARE PLAIN TEXT. `AskUserQuestion` TIMES OUT in this cloud container, so a gate that
     "asks" cannot fire. Every "invoke ask-human" below means: print the question, a minimal
     concrete example, numbered options, and the recommended option FIRST with its reason, as
     ordinary prose — then STOP and wait. Protocol: `.claude/skills/ask-human/SKILL.md`.
  2. NO `advisor()` HERE — the tool does not exist in this environment. Independent certification =
     fresh-context read-only reviewer subagents (`.claude/agents/`), per CLAUDE.md
     § "Certification ladder". Self-grading is the last resort and MUST be disclosed as self-graded.
  3. REPORTS GO TO `var/claude/…` in the repo — gitignored (`/var`), survives compaction inside the
     session, never committed. NOT `~/.claude/projects/…`: that is wiped when the container is
     reclaimed, so a report written there is lost.
  4. `--scope=global|both` IS REMOVED wherever it appears: `~/.claude/` in this container is
     GENERATED from repo files by `scripts/claude-bootstrap/install.sh`, so auditing it audits a copy.
  5. ≤5 concurrent subagents (10 caused ~50% rate-limit failures upstream). Every pipeline agent
     writes its raw output to `var/claude/<stage>/raw/` BEFORE returning — autocompact fires at 80%
     here and in-conversation results do not survive it.
  6. PROJECT RULES WIN on any conflict: `/home/user/pdfturbo/CLAUDE.md` — the deploy gate, the
     certification ladder, the git-autonomy override, and the in-repo plan homes.

# /aggregate-findings

## When to use
Run after **two or more** of `/inspect`, `/sleuth`, `/gaps`, `/sweep`, `/inspect --vision` have produced reports, to synthesize them into one deduplicated, prioritized master list. (`/mega-analysis` was NOT imported — the 2026-07-27 integration — so there is no umbrella run to key off: the stage set is simply whatever reports exist under `var/claude/`.)

## Flags
- `--top=N` — show only the top N unique findings (default: all)
- `--since=<date>` — only aggregate reports dated on/after this (default: the most recent report per skill)

## Step 0 — Locate reports

```bash
# Reports live in the repo under var/ (gitignored) — see the adaptation header.
REPO_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$PWD}"
REPORT_ROOT="$REPO_ROOT/var/claude"
mkdir -p "$REPORT_ROOT/reports"
# Enumerate what actually exists — this list IS the stage set:
find "$REPORT_ROOT" -name '*.md' -not -path '*/reports/*' | sort
```

Enumerate every report found and state the count before reading — an unlisted report is a coverage gap.

## Step 1 — Read all stage reports (parallel, max 5 at a time)

Read every report enumerated in Step 0, in batches of ≤5 files (the project's concurrency ceiling for LLM-backed agents is 5). Typical stage set here: `/inspect`, `/inspect --vision`, `/sleuth`, `/gaps`, `/sweep`. There is no global-scope pass — those flags were removed on import.

Read each file and pass to Step 2.

## Step 2 — Spawn 3 synthesis agents (parallel)

Spawn exactly 3 agents with the full report content:

### Agent 1: Deduplication detector
Prompt: "You are given N stage reports from this project's review skills. Your job is to identify findings that appear in 2 or more stage reports — these are the highest-confidence issues. For each cross-stage finding, list: the finding name/ID, which stages mention it, what each stage says (noting any contradictions), and a deduplicated one-sentence summary. Output as a markdown table. Only report findings that appear in ≥2 stages."

### Agent 2: Priority ranker
Prompt: "You are given N stage reports from this project's review skills. Your job is to produce a single master priority list of ALL unique findings (not cross-stage-only), ranked by: (1) severity (P0/High before P1/Med), (2) fix cost (Quick before Long), (3) breadth of impact. Remove exact duplicates. Format: numbered list with severity badge, one-line description, estimated fix time, and which stage it came from. Cap at 50 entries."

### Agent 3: Quick wins extractor
Prompt: "You are given N stage reports from this project's review skills. Your job is to extract all 'quick win' findings: severity P1 or higher AND fix cost ≤30 min. These are the highest-value, lowest-effort items. Output as a table: finding, stage, exact file/line, exact fix, minutes. Include at most 20 rows; rank by impact."

## Step 3 — Synthesize into consolidated report

Combine all 3 agent outputs into:

```markdown
# Aggregate Findings — <date>
Generated: <timestamp> | Stages: <N, named> | Raw findings: ~<N> | Unique after dedup: ~<N>

## Top 10 Cross-Stage Findings (appear in ≥2 stages — highest confidence)
[Agent 1 table]

## Quick Wins (P1+ / ≤30 min fix)
[Agent 3 table]

## Master Priority List (all unique findings, ranked)
[Agent 2 list]
```

## Step 4 — Save and report

Save to `var/claude/reports/aggregate-<date>.md` (gitignored — never `git add` it).

Report to user:
- Total unique findings
- Cross-stage duplicates found and collapsed
- Top 5 quick wins
- Suggest: "Run `/aggregate-findings --top=10` to see just the highest priority items"
- Name any report that existed but could not be parsed — a silently dropped stage is a coverage lie

## Self-reflection
After saving, note any findings where the stages disagreed (e.g., one stage calls it P0, another calls it P2). Flag these as "conflicting severity" in the report.
