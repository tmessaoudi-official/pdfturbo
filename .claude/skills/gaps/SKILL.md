  pdfturbo CONTAINER ADAPTATION (2026-07-27). Imported from the developer's machine bundle
  `claude-setup-global-20260722` via the already-container-adapted phorj port. These deltas
  OVERRIDE the body below wherever they conflict:

  1. QUESTIONS ARE PLAIN TEXT. `AskUserQuestion` TIMES OUT in this cloud container, so a gate that
     "asks" cannot fire. Every "invoke ask-human" below means: print the question, a minimal
     concrete example, numbered options, and the recommended option FIRST with its reason, as
     ordinary prose — then STOP and wait. Protocol: `.claude/skills/ask-human/SKILL.md`.
  2. NO `advisor()` HERE — the tool does not exist in this environment. Independent certification =
     fresh-context read-only reviewer subagents (`.claude/agents/`), per CLAUDE.md
     § "Certification ladder". Self-grading is the last resort and MUST be disclosed as self-graded.
  3. REPORTS GO TO `var/claude/…` in the repo — gitignored (`/var`), survives compaction inside the
     session, never committed. NOT `~/.claude/projects/…`: that is wiped when the container is
     reclaimed, so a report written there is lost.
  4. `--scope=global|both` IS REMOVED wherever it appears: `~/.claude/` in this container is
     GENERATED from repo files by `scripts/claude-bootstrap/install.sh`, so auditing it audits a copy.
  5. ≤5 concurrent subagents (10 caused ~50% rate-limit failures upstream). Every pipeline agent
     writes its raw output to `var/claude/<stage>/raw/` BEFORE returning — autocompact fires at 80%
     here and in-conversation results do not survive it.
  6. PROJECT RULES WIN on any conflict: `/home/user/pdfturbo/CLAUDE.md` — the deploy gate, the
     certification ladder, the git-autonomy override, and the in-repo plan homes.

# /gaps — Incompleteness & Missing Feature Detector

Hunt for incomplete implementations, missing features, unfulfilled promises, and pending work across the entire project. Produces a prioritized roadmap. **Never auto-applies — presents a ranked plan and waits for explicit direction.**

Differentiation from `/inspect`: `/inspect` finds *what's wrong with existing things*. `/gaps` finds *what's missing or unfinished* — features described but not implemented, code started but not completed, documentation that promises things the code doesn't deliver.

Use `--quick` (agents A, F, H only — debt markers, test gaps, error handling; ~3 min), `--focus=<A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I|J>` (single agent), `--target=<path>` (analyze a specific directory; overrides `--scope`), `--scope=project|global|both` (project: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` [default]; global: `~/.claude/`; both: run project then global, two separate reports), `--priority=high` (Now items only — skip Soon/Later).

---

## Step 0: Setup

```bash
# --scope flag (--target overrides --scope when both are provided — explicit path wins):
#   --scope=project (default when no --target): TARGET=$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR
#   --scope=global:                             TARGET=~/.claude/
#   --scope=both:                               run entire skill twice — project first, then global
TARGET="${target_arg:-${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$PWD}}"
if [[ -z "${target_arg:-}" ]]; then
  [[ "$ARGUMENTS" =~ --scope=global ]] && TARGET="$HOME/.claude/"
  # --scope=both: run a second pass with TARGET=~/.claude/ after completing the project pass
fi
PROJECT_SLUG=$(echo "$TARGET" | sed 's|^/|-|; s|/|-|g')
GAPS_DIR="$HOME/.claude/projects/$PROJECT_SLUG/gaps"
mkdir -p "$GAPS_DIR"
TODAY=$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M)
REPORT_PATH="${output_arg:-$GAPS_DIR/$TODAY.md}"
PRIOR_GAPS=$(ls "$GAPS_DIR"/*.md 2>/dev/null | sort -r | head -1 || true)
```

Announce: "Scanning gaps: `$TARGET` → saving to `$REPORT_PATH`"

If a prior `/gaps` run exists: note its date. Agents will flag items that have been pending since the prior run as [STALE], helping prioritize chronic incompleteness over fresh debt.

**`--scope=both` handling**: If `--scope=both` was passed and `--target` was NOT explicitly set, run the entire skill once for the project scope (`TARGET=$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`), then automatically re-invoke the full skill a second time with `TARGET=~/.claude/` — two separate reports. Announce both paths at the end.

## Step 1: Detect Project Context

```bash
ls "$TARGET"/{package.json,Cargo.toml,pyproject.toml,go.mod,Makefile,docker-compose*.yaml,README.md} 2>/dev/null
[[ -f "$TARGET/CLAUDE.md" ]] && head -60 "$TARGET/CLAUDE.md"
git -C "$TARGET" log --oneline -10 2>/dev/null || true
find "$TARGET" -maxdepth 2 -name "*.md" -o -name "*.sh" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.py" 2>/dev/null | head -20
```

Summarize: tech stack, approximate project age (from git log), primary language, team size (from commit authors). Pass as `PROJECT_CONTEXT` to each agent.

## Step 2: Spawn Gap-Detection Agents

Respect flags:
- `--quick`: spawn only agents A, F, H (debt markers, test gaps, error handling)
- `--priority=high`: instruct agents to report Now-priority items only
- `--focus=<X>`: spawn only that agent
- Default: spawn in two sequential batches — **never exceed 5 concurrent LLM agents** (5 is the proven rate-limit ceiling; >5 causes ~50% failures):
  - **Batch 1**: spawn agents A–E in one message; wait for all 5 to complete before continuing
  - **Batch 2**: spawn agents F–J in one message; wait for all 5 to complete

**Agent A: Explicit Debt Markers** — TODO, FIXME, HACK, XXX, WORKAROUND, BUG, KLUDGE comments; classified by age and actionability.

**Agent B: Stubs & Placeholder Detection** — empty function bodies, `raise NotImplementedError`, hardcoded placeholder returns, shell scripts with TODO bodies.

**Agent C: Partial Feature Implementations** — unhandled switch cases, parsed-but-unused CLI flags, stub API handlers, features with empty branches, state machines with missing transitions.

**Agent D: Undocumented Features (code exists, docs absent)** — commands not in CLAUDE.md, env vars not in .env.example, Makefile targets not in README, hook scripts not in docs.

**Agent E: Promised Features (docs mention, code missing)** — commands in CLAUDE.md with no file, env vars documented but never read, workflows referencing scripts that don't exist.

**Agent F: Missing Tests for Named Features** — named features with zero tests, error paths with no test, workflows with no integration test.

**Agent G: Config & Environment Gaps** — env vars used but not in .env.example, required config with no startup validation, placeholder values with no format hint.

**Agent H: Missing Error Handling Paths** — happy path without error path, silent switch/if fall-throughs, cleanup that runs on success but not failure.

**Agent I: Template & Placeholder Markers** — `<!-- ADAPT: -->` markers, unactivated `.sh.template` files, `{{VAR}}` placeholders, skeleton banners still present.

**Agent J: Integration & Dependency Stubs** — interfaces with no concrete implementation, abstract base classes never subclassed, plugin systems with no plugins registered, unused imports, Makefile targets calling non-existent scripts.

## Step 3: Synthesize Gaps Report

```markdown
# /gaps Report — <DATE>
Scanned: <DATE> | Project: <TARGET> | Stack: <PROJECT_CONTEXT>

## Executive Summary
[3-5 sentences: dominant type of incompleteness, most actionable gap, overall completeness feel]

## Priority Roadmap

### NOW — Act immediately (blocking or high-impact)
| # | Category | Gap | Location | Effort |

### SOON — Important but not blocking
| # | Category | Gap | Location | Effort |

### LATER — Nice to have
| # | Category | Gap | Location | Effort |

## Findings by Category
[A through J sections]

## Stale Gaps [CHRONIC] *(only if prior run exists)*
Items present in prior run that are still unfilled.

## Quick Wins (Effort=Quick, Priority=Now or Soon)
| # | Category | Gap | Next action |
```

## Step 4: Save Report

Write the synthesized report to `$REPORT_PATH`.

## Step 4b: Self-Reflection

Spawn ONE agent to reflect on this command's own definition using the just-saved report as evidence. Pass the actual `$REPORT_PATH` value. The agent produces its blind spots, prompt drift, and proposed changes sections, then reads `$REPORT_PATH` and writes the complete updated file (original content + its block) using the Write tool. Returns only: "Self-reflection appended." Parent announces: "Self-reflection complete — see `$REPORT_PATH`"

## Step 5: Present Roadmap — Hard Stop

Show: Executive summary, full NOW table, Quick Wins table, counts of SOON/LATER.

**Ask in PLAIN TEXT** (per `/ask-human` — `AskUserQuestion` is forbidden here) and STOP:

```
N gaps found (Now: X | Soon: Y | Later: Z). Nothing has been changed — every finding above is
a proposal.

1. Fix specific gaps (recommended) — name the IDs, e.g. `G1, G3`.
2. Show all Soon items.
3. Show one category in full — name it, e.g. `category B`.
4. Nothing — close the report.
```

*Never auto-fills anything. The user decides what to close.*
