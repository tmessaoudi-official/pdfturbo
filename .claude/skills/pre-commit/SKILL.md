  pdfturbo CONTAINER ADAPTATION (2026-07-27). Imported from the developer's machine bundle
  `claude-setup-global-20260722` via the already-container-adapted phorj port. These deltas
  OVERRIDE the body below wherever they conflict:

  1. QUESTIONS ARE PLAIN TEXT. `AskUserQuestion` TIMES OUT in this cloud container, so a gate that
     "asks" cannot fire. Every "invoke ask-human" below means: print the question, a minimal
     concrete example, numbered options, and the recommended option FIRST with its reason, as
     ordinary prose — then STOP and wait. Protocol: `.claude/skills/ask-human/SKILL.md`.
  2. NO `advisor()` HERE — the tool does not exist in this environment. Independent certification =
     fresh-context read-only reviewer subagents (`.claude/agents/`), per CLAUDE.md
     § "Certification ladder". Self-grading is the last resort and MUST be disclosed as self-graded.
  3. REPORTS GO TO `var/claude/…` in the repo — gitignored (`/var`), survives compaction inside the
     session, never committed. NOT `~/.claude/projects/…`: that is wiped when the container is
     reclaimed, so a report written there is lost.
  4. `--scope=global|both` IS REMOVED wherever it appears: `~/.claude/` in this container is
     GENERATED from repo files by `scripts/claude-bootstrap/install.sh`, so auditing it audits a copy.
  5. ≤5 concurrent subagents (10 caused ~50% rate-limit failures upstream). Every pipeline agent
     writes its raw output to `var/claude/<stage>/raw/` BEFORE returning — autocompact fires at 80%
     here and in-conversation results do not survive it.
  6. PROJECT RULES WIN on any conflict: `/home/user/pdfturbo/CLAUDE.md` — the deploy gate, the
     certification ladder, the git-autonomy override, and the in-repo plan homes.

## Differentiation from related skills

| Skill | Scope | Use when |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `/sweep` | Full codebase, read-only smell review | You want architectural smell detection across all files, no git integration |
| `/pre-commit` | Staged diff only, commit ritual gate | You are about to commit — need blast-radius check + evidence table + commit command |

---

## Side effects

**None** — this skill is read-only. It runs `git diff --staged` and `grep` to analyse staged changes, then displays a report and commit command. It never calls `git commit` and never modifies any file. Output is displayed in conversation only — not persisted to disk; the git commit is the durable artifact.

---

## Step 0 — Precondition checks

**No task gate here (pdfturbo adaptation).** Upstream stops to confirm size and intent before Step 1.
This repo's standing directive is no interrupts, and `git add` / `git commit` / `git push` are all
**autonomously authorised** (CLAUDE.md § "Git autonomy") — so this skill's job is the evidence table
and the blast-radius check, never asking permission. State the task size in one line and continue.

**When this skill DOES stop**: only if an evidence row comes back INCOMPLETE (Step 5) — that is a real
finding, not a check-in, and it is reported in plain text per `/ask-human`.

**Git checks** (in order; stop at first failure):
1. Verify `git` is installed: `command -v git` — if not found, report `ERROR: git not found in PATH — cannot run /pre-commit` and stop.
2. Verify inside a git repo: `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree 2>/dev/null` — if fails, report `ERROR: Not inside a git repository` and stop.
3. Check staged changes exist: `git diff --staged --name-only` — if empty, report `ERROR: No staged changes. Stage files with git add before running /pre-commit.` and stop.
4. Detect active merge/rebase: test for `.git/MERGE_HEAD` and `.git/rebase-merge/` — if either exists, add `WARN: Merge or rebase in progress — evidence table will be produced but commit command will not be shown until the merge/rebase completes.`

---

## Step 1 — Inventory staged changes

Run `git diff --staged --stat` and `git diff --staged --name-only`. For each staged file, record:
- Status: Added / Modified / Deleted / Renamed
- File path and extension
- Lines changed summary

Classify each file:
- **Public interface** — CLI flags, env vars, public functions, documented commands, API contracts, hook behaviour, SKILL.md
- **Internal implementation** — logic, business rules, private helpers
- **Tests** — test files, fixtures, test helpers
- **Config/infra** — Dockerfiles, compose files, Makefile, shell scripts, YAML config
- **Docs** — CLAUDE.md, README, agent definitions, refs/SKILLS.md

---

## Step 2 — Blast-radius analysis

For each file in the **Public interface** or **Config/infra** categories:
1. Extract the changed symbol, flag, function name, or path from the diff
2. Search all references: `grep -r "<symbol>" ~/.claude/ --include="*.md" --include="*.sh" --include="*.json" -l 2>/dev/null`
3. For each hit, read the relevant line and determine if it is a caller, doc reference, or config entry that may need updating
4. Flag any reference NOT already present in the staged diff as a **potential blast-radius item**

If a staged file is a deletion: note that all remaining callers are blast-radius items.

---

## Step 3 — Four-dimension evidence table

Produce the completion gate table from CLAUDE.md Rule 6:

```
| Dimension    | Status | Evidence |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| Coverage     | OK / INCOMPLETE | <test files staged, OR bash -n / exit-code checks if infra, OR "no test suite — N/A with reason"> |
| Docs         | OK / INCOMPLETE | <SKILL.md / README / help text staged, OR "no public interface changed"> |
| Config       | OK / INCOMPLETE | <CLAUDE.md / agent def / SKILLS.md staged, OR "no config impact — <reason>"> |
| Blast radius | OK / INCOMPLETE | <grep hits accounted for, OR list of unresolved references> |
```

**INCOMPLETE** rows block the commit command in Step 5. List exactly what must be staged to resolve each INCOMPLETE row.

Output is displayed in conversation only — not persisted to disk; the git commit is the durable artifact.

---

## Step 4 — Commit message

Parse `--message=<text>` from args if provided. Otherwise derive a draft from the staged diff:
- One imperative-mood subject line (≤72 chars): what changed and the functional reason
- Optionally 1-3 short bullet lines for non-obvious context

**Never append `Co-Authored-By: Claude`** or any Claude attribution (CLAUDE.md Rule 10).

---

## Step 5 — Present commit command

If all four evidence rows are **OK**:

```
All four dimensions satisfied. Run this command:

git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<commit message here>
EOF
)"
```

If any row is **INCOMPLETE**: list what is missing and do NOT present the commit command. The commit is blocked until all dimensions are resolved — add the missing staged changes and re-run `/pre-commit`.

---

## Error handling summary

| Condition | Behaviour |
|-----------|----------|
| `git` binary not in PATH | ERROR + stop immediately |
| Not inside a git repo | ERROR + stop immediately |
| No staged changes | ERROR + stop immediately |
| Active merge or rebase | WARN — continue to evidence table, suppress commit command |
| `grep` unavailable or returns non-zero | Skip that symbol; note in blast-radius row as "grep unavailable for `<symbol>`" |
| Staged deletion | Note that all remaining callers of the deleted item are blast-radius items |
| Binary file staged | Note in coverage row as "binary file — no diff available; verify manually" |
