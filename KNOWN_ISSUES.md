# PDFturbo — Known Limitations & Structural Ceilings

PDFturbo runs **entirely in the browser** with no backend and nothing uploaded. That design
choice is the product's core value — and it also sets hard limits in a few places: where a glyph
outline simply isn't present in the file, where the target format can't represent the source, or
where a library/spec doesn't expose the operation.

The items below are **not defects and not on a fix list** — they are the honest edges of a pure
client-side editor. Each notes the "escape hatch" that *would* lift it and the trade-off of taking
it, so the limit is understood rather than mistaken for a bug.

## Privacy — data at rest (by design)

To restore your work after a reload, PDFturbo saves the open document — **including the raw PDF
bytes** — in your browser's **IndexedDB**. This data never leaves your device, but it is stored
**unencrypted** like normal browser site data. Use **"Start fresh"** on load, clear site data, or
work in a private/incognito window when editing sensitive documents on a shared machine. See
[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

## Escape-hatch families (the levers — most ceilings map to one)

| EH | Lever | Unlocks | Trade-off |
|----|-------|---------|-----------|
| **EH-A** | **PDFium-WASM** (page-object text API) | True in-place edit of *any* font incl. subset/CID/Type3 (C1–C4) | Several-MB WASM payload; a 2nd engine beside pdf.js + pdf-lib; build/CI complexity |
| **EH-B** | **HarfBuzz-WASM** shaping + bidi-js (already a dep) | Arabic/complex-script char-level shaping + mixed LTR↔RTL single line + tashkeel (C2, C8, C18, C19) | Another WASM dep; shaping↔ToUnicode tension still limits exact Arabic search (C14) |
| **EH-C** | **Page-as-image** export | DOCX/export pixel-identity (C5) | Destroys editable/selectable/searchable text — defeats the DOCX use-case |
| **EH-D** | **Server-side conversion** (headless LibreOffice / render service) | Best-in-class fidelity (C5), TSA/LTV signing (C17) | **Breaks the no-backend / nothing-uploaded promise** — off the table unless that promise changes |
| **EH-E** | **Whitespace-inference table detection** | **RELEASED for CSV (C13) 2026-08-04**; DOCX (C9) still gated | The confidence gate exists and its load-bearing rule is the multi-column-page discriminator (a table's rows span columns; a two-column page's lines do not). Ruled tables keep priority, so lattice output is unchanged |

## The structural ceilings (C1–C21)

| ID | Ceiling | Why it's structural | Escape hatch |
|----|---------|---------------------|--------------|
| C1 | In-place edit of subset/CID fonts with a **new** glyph | The new character's outline is absent from the embedded subset | EH-A (today: reuse in-subset glyphs, else base-14 redraw or overlay) |
| C2 | Arabic in-place true-edit | Subset CID font + no client-side shaping/bidi | EH-A + EH-B (today: refuses → overlay, which renders correctly) |
| C3 | Type3 / Form-XObject true-edit | Type3 glyphs are CharProcs; XObject text has its own space | EH-A (today: overlay) |
| C4 | `cm` rotation/shear in the Path-3 redraw | Standard-font redraw flattens to an axis-aligned matrix | EH-A (today: translation-only redraw) |
| C5 | PDF→DOCX **pixel-identity** | Fixed-layout → reflowable is lossy by definition | EH-C (kills text) or EH-D. Target is high-fidelity *editable*, not identical |
| C6 | DOCX subset-font **face** | Subset tag strips the family name (~75% face accuracy) | EH-D or font-fingerprinting. Content is exact; only typeface is approximate |
| C7 | DOCX CJK font-face | No universal CJK family; content preserved, face approximate | Word's own fallback renders the codepoints |
| C8 | DOCX char-level bidi / mixed LTR+RTL single line | Word-level reorder only | EH-B |
| C9 | DOCX **borderless** tables | The EH-E engine now exists and works (C13), but is deliberately NOT wired into the DOCX flow: `reconstructPage` REMOVES in-region words from the paragraph flow, so a false positive would silently turn prose into a table. CSV is user-invoked, so a miss there is discardable | EH-E — a wiring change plus a stricter threshold, not new work |
| C10 | DOCX **4+** column layout | Recursive XY-cut ships (B6) but is depth-capped; 3 columns work, 4 measured as 3 groups | Deeper recursion / a looser gutter threshold. Corrected 2026-07-31 — this row previously said "Reconstructor is 2-column", which B6 had already made false |
| C11 | DOCX internal GoTo links / sheared images / ICC spot colour | No DOCX representation / no client ICC engine | EH-D. External URL links already work |
| C12 | Markup-annotation flatten | pdf-lib has no generic markup-flatten API | Raster path (covers the redaction-rasterise case) |
| ~~C13~~ | ~~Borderless table → CSV~~ | **CLOSED 2026-08-04** — EH-E released for the CSV path (`src/utils/borderlessTable.ts`): columns inferred from global whitespace bands, behind a confidence gate that refuses rather than guesses | — |
| C14 | Arabic searchable-OCR **exact search** | Shaping yields contextual glyphs with incomplete ToUnicode | EH-B + richer ToUnicode. Selectable/screen-reader text already works |
| C15 | OCR recognition **accuracy** | Bounded by the tesseract LSTM model | Cloud OCR (breaks EH-D) or a larger local model |
| C16 | Encryption R6 hash-hardening | `@cantoo/pdf-lib` hardcodes R:5 | Fork/patch. AES-256 R5 is already strong |
| C17 | PAdES / TSA / LTV / CA-trusted signatures | node-forge can't emit ESS signing-cert-v2; TSA/LTV need a backend | Hand-rolled CAdES + EH-D. Valid ISO-32000 `adbe.pkcs7.detached` ships today |
| C18 | RTL text-layer select/copy/search **precision** | pdf.js builds the layer per-glyph, visual-order; highlight is item-level | EH-B. Logical copy/search reconstruction already works |
| C19 | Arabic overlay tashkeel/GPOS micro-positioning | Needs a GPOS shaper; legibility is already fine | EH-B |
| C20 | XFDF Acrobat byte-exactness + rotated-page coords | No Acrobat to verify against | Internal round-trip is the correctness guarantee |
| C21 | Raster ink — no per-stroke edit | Rasterised by design | Use the **vector** freehand tool |

## Deferred / nice-to-have (non-blocking)

- **Arabic locale strings** — DONE (2026-07-30): all 31 previously-unverified keys reviewed and
  validated by a native speaker, with no value changes needed. **RTL rendering was not part of that
  review** and is unchanged — see ceilings C18 (select/copy/search precision) and C19 (tashkeel/GPOS),
  plus overlay bracket mirroring and RTL list-marker placement. Correct strings, imperfect shaping.
- Resizable crop handles / numeric crop margins (today: drag-to-set + re-drag).
- **XLSX table export** — DONE (2026-08-04): `src/export/xlsxWriter.ts`, no new dependency (XLSX is OPC,
  written with the fflate `zipSync` this repo already uses for DOCX). Shares table detection with the CSV
  export, and writes numeric cells as real numbers so a price column can be summed.
- Open-via-picker + recent-files for the native save dialog.

> Releasing any escape hatch is a deliberate, per-need decision — most cost multi-MB dependencies,
> significant build complexity, or the no-backend privacy promise. **EH-E is released for the CSV *and* XLSX table exports
> (2026-08-04)** — both call the same `_resolveTableGrid`, and the harm reasoning is identical: each runs
> only when the user explicitly asked for a table., which was possible precisely because it costs none of those three: no dependency, no
> WASM, no backend — only an algorithm and a confidence gate. EH-A through EH-D remain un-greenlit.
