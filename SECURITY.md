## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities in public GitHub issues.**

Use GitHub's private [security advisory](https://github.com/tmessaoudi-official/pdfturbo/security/advisories/new) to report vulnerabilities confidentially.

Include:
- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce it
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fix (optional)

You can expect an acknowledgment within 48 hours and a resolution within 14 days for confirmed issues.

## Scope

This is a **client-side only** application — no server, no database, no user accounts. All PDF processing happens in your browser. All libraries (pdf.js, pdf-lib, and others) are bundled via npm — no CDN dependencies, no external network requests at runtime.

Security concerns most relevant to this project:
- XSS via malicious PDF content
- Malicious PDF files causing unexpected behavior in pdf.js
- Privacy: PDFs are processed locally and never uploaded anywhere

## Data at rest (session persistence)

To restore your work after a reload, PDFturbo saves the open document — **including the raw
PDF bytes** — in your browser's **IndexedDB**. This data:

- **never leaves your device** (no upload, no sync, no network);
- is stored **unencrypted**, like normal browser site data, so anyone with access to your OS
  user profile / browser data can read it;
- persists until you clear it. Use **"Start fresh"** on load, clear site data, or use a
  private/incognito window if you are editing sensitive documents on a shared machine.

If you need stronger guarantees for sensitive files, edit them in a private window and do not
restore the saved session.
